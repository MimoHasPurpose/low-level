# WeeklyMotivation
The following program is in c++, which can be implemented in jquery or Python gui library, to provide a user interface, along with adding images to the U.I as per the students performance
Use Cases:
1. Used to monitor the performance of an employee, and providing solution upon reduction in task motivation
2. Can be further expanded to include amount of time the user worked on the task
3. can be "          "      to kind of emotional state while performing task
4. used to monitor emotional state, and inclination of worker towards self harming behaviour
5. If a  depressive, destructive emotional state is maintained for a week parallel to reduction in motivation of a worker
  it can be safely concluded that the worker is having onset of depression
6. Further expanding the application we can use it to monitor how medicines affect the motivation levels of a patient
7. A class can be used to construct objects which will hold the required name of patient, its id, its medications and a user specific file
   

Possible Implementation:
1. We can use jquery to build a website and upload it on github
2. we can use sql and php to maintain database
3. we can use linux to maintain cronjobs that automatically create file and take inputs
4. we can use python GUI interface to create an application for anderoids
5.
